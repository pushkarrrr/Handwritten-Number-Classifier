# HandWritten_Number_Classifier
 This classifier predicts the value of a handwritten number using Decision Tree

**Software and Libraries**
- Python 3.6.0
- Anaconda 4.3.0 (64 bit)
- scikit-learn 0.18.1

**Introduction**  
The dataset for this project has been collected from Kaggle. Link - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data.
- The data contains 21000 pictures of handwritten numbers as the value of their pixels.

**Working of the HandWritten_Number_Classifier**
- The program takes data from the train.csv downloaded from the link mentioned above.
- The program then splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
- An example of this is also visualised by plotting the handwritten number using the value of its pixels by using matlplotlib .
- An accuracy of 82.38% was achieved by this model
